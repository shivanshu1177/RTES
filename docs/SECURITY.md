# RTES Security Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Real-Time Trading Exchange Simulator (RTES) to address critical vulnerabilities identified during code review.

## Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. Log Injection Prevention (CWE-117)
**Problem**: Unsanitized user input in log messages could allow log injection attacks.

**Solution**: 
- Created `SecurityUtils::sanitize_log_input()` function
- Removes control characters (0x00-0x1F, 0x7F)
- Escapes special characters (\n, \r, \t, \\, ")
- Updated all logging calls to use sanitized input

**Files Modified**:
- `include/rtes/security_utils.hpp`
- `src/security_utils.cpp`
- `include/rtes/logger.hpp`
- `src/logger.cpp`

### 2. Path Traversal Prevention (CWE-22/23/24)
**Problem**: Configuration file loading vulnerable to path traversal attacks.

**Solution**:
- Created `SecurityUtils::validate_file_path()` function
- Validates paths against allowed base directories
- Uses canonical path resolution to prevent traversal
- Restricts config loading to approved directories only

**Files Modified**:
- `src/config.cpp`
- Added path validation in `Config::load_from_file()`

### 3. Format String Vulnerability Fix (CWE-134)
**Problem**: Unsafe printf-style formatting could lead to format string attacks.

**Solution**:
- Removed all `printf`/`vsnprintf` usage
- Implemented type-safe `SecurityUtils::safe_format()` using `std::format`
- Added error handling for format exceptions
- Created secure logging template methods

**Files Modified**:
- `include/rtes/logger.hpp`
- `src/logger.cpp`

### 4. Authorization and Authentication (CWE-862)
**Problem**: Missing authorization checks for sensitive operations.

**Solution**:
- Implemented role-based access control (RBAC)
- Created `AuthMiddleware` class for request authentication
- Added `AuthContext` with user roles and permissions
- Integrated authentication into TCP gateway
- Added ownership validation for order operations

**Files Added**:
- `include/rtes/auth_middleware.hpp`
- `src/auth_middleware.cpp`

**Files Modified**:
- `include/rtes/tcp_gateway.hpp`
- `src/tcp_gateway.cpp`

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. Client sends authentication token with each request
2. `AuthMiddleware::authenticate_and_authorize()` validates token
3. Creates `AuthContext` with user role and permissions
4. Checks operation authorization before processing
5. Logs security events for audit trail

### User Roles
- **ADMIN**: Full system access, can shutdown, manage users
- **TRADER**: Can place/cancel orders, view positions
- **VIEWER**: Read-only access to market data
- **SYSTEM**: Internal system operations

### Input Validation
All user inputs are validated using `SecurityUtils` functions:
- Symbol names: Alphanumeric, uppercase only, max 10 chars
- Order IDs: Alphanumeric with hyphens/underscores, max 20 chars
- Client IDs: Safe string validation (no control characters)

### Secure Logging
- All log messages sanitized to prevent injection
- Type-safe formatting prevents format string attacks
- Structured logging option for security monitoring
- Rate limiting prevents log flooding

## Security Testing

### Test Coverage
- Log injection prevention tests
- Path traversal attack tests
- Input validation boundary tests
- Authentication and authorization tests
- Secure logging functionality tests

**Test File**: `tests/test_security.cpp`

## Production Deployment Recommendations

### 1. Authentication Enhancement
- Replace mock authentication with proper JWT/OAuth2
- Implement token expiration and refresh
- Add multi-factor authentication for admin users
- Use secure token storage (encrypted, httpOnly cookies)

### 2. Network Security
- Enable TLS/SSL for all network communications
- Implement certificate pinning
- Add IP whitelisting for admin operations
- Use VPN for internal communications

### 3. Monitoring and Auditing
- Deploy security event monitoring (SIEM)
- Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
- Log all administrative actions
- Implement anomaly detection for trading patterns

### 4. Additional Hardening
- Run with minimal privileges (non-root user)
- Enable address space layout randomization (ASLR)
- Use stack canaries and control flow integrity
- Regular security scanning and penetration testing

## Security Metrics

The following security metrics should be monitored:
- Failed authentication attempts per minute
- Authorization failures by user/operation
- Input validation failures
- Suspicious trading patterns
- System access outside business hours

## Compliance

This implementation addresses:
- **OWASP Top 10**: Injection, Broken Authentication, Security Logging
- **CWE Standards**: CWE-117, CWE-22/23/24, CWE-134, CWE-862
- **Financial Industry Standards**: Input validation, audit trails, access controls

## Security Contact

For security issues or questions:
- Create security-related GitHub issues with `security` label
- Follow responsible disclosure for vulnerabilities
- Regular security reviews recommended quarterly
